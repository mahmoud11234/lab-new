Objective:
•	Configure the minimum password length policy for Active Directory users using Group Policy.

Prerequisites:
•	Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) installed and configured.
•	Administrative access to the domain controller.

Steps:
1.	Open the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC):
a. Press the Windows key + R to open the Run dialog box.
b. Type "gpmc.msc" and press Enter.

2.	Create a new Group Policy Object (GPO) or edit an existing one:
a. Right-click on the domain or organizational unit (OU) where you want to apply the password policy.
b. Select "Create a GPO in this domain, and Link it here" to create a new GPO.
c. Provide a descriptive name for the GPO, such as "Password Policy," and click OK.

3.	Edit the GPO:
a. Right-click on the newly created GPO and select "Edit" to open the Group Policy Management Editor.

4.	Navigate to the Password Policy settings:
a. In the Group Policy Management Editor, expand the following folders:
o	Computer Configuration
o	Policies
o	Windows Settings
o	Security Settings
o	Account Policies
b. Click on "Password Policy."

5.	Configure the minimum password length:
a. In the right pane, double-click on "Minimum password length."
b. In the "Minimum password length" dialog box, select the "Define this policy setting" checkbox.
c. Enter the desired minimum password length in the "Password must be at least" field. For example, enter "12" to set a minimum password length of 12 characters.
d. Click Apply and then OK to save the changes.

6.	Close the Group Policy Management Editor.

7.	Link the GPO to the desired organizational unit (OU) or domain:
a. In the Group Policy Management Console, right-click on the OU or domain where you want to apply the password policy.
b. Select "Link an Existing GPO."
c. Choose the GPO you just created (e.g., "Password Policy") and click OK.

8.	Force Group Policy update (optional):
a. If you want to immediately apply the changes to the users, you can force a Group Policy update on the client computers.
b. Open the Command Prompt or PowerShell as an administrator on the client computer.
c. Run the command: gpupdate /force

9.	Verify the password policy:
a. Log in to a client computer with a user account affected by the GPO.
b. Press Ctrl + Alt + Delete and select "Change a password."
c. Attempt to set a password that is shorter than the minimum length specified in the GPO.
d. Verify that the system enforces the minimum password length and displays an error message if the password is too short.

That's it! You have successfully configured the minimum password length policy using Group Policy in Active Directory. Users will now be required to set passwords that meet the specified minimum length requirement.
